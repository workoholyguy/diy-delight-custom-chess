# WEB103 Project 4 - Custom Chess Studio

Submitted by: **Omar Madjitov**

About this web app: A React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL app to browse chess pieces and customize them by color, board, and material with live preview and pricing. Users can save custom pieces, view their list, edit, and delete. Server-side rules enforce material ↔ board compatibility.

Time spent: **12** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->
- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API.**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured `CustomItem` table.**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [x] **Users can view multiple features of the `CustomItem` (e.g., wheels, exterior, etc.)**
- [x] **Each customizable feature has multiple options to choose from (e.g., exterior could be red, blue, black, etc.)**
- [x] **On selecting each option, the displayed visual icon for the `CustomItem` updates to match the option the user chose.**
- [x] **The price of the `CustomItem` (e.g., car) changes dynamically as different options are selected OR the app displays the total price of all features.**
- [x] **The visual interface changes in response to at least one customizable feature.**
- [x] **The user can submit their choices to save the item to the list of created `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **If a user submits a feature combo that is impossible, they should receive an appropriate error message and the item should not be saved to the database.**
- [x] **Users can view a list of all submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can edit a submitted `CustomItem` from the list view of submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can delete a submitted `CustomItem` from the list view of submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can update or delete `CustomItem`s that have been created from the detail page.**


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Selecting particular options prevents incompatible options from being selected even before form submission

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Challenges and notes

- Ensuring material selection worked even when the seed dataset did not include every color×material variant; resolved by falling back to the nearest preview for image/price.
- Enforcing a clear and intuitive “Material ↔ Board” rule both client-side (UX feedback) and server-side (data integrity).
- Improving dark-mode contrast so text remains readable across themes.
